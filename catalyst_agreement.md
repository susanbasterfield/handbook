# Agreement: Enspiral Catalysts


###Roles & Responsibilities

Enspiral members are responsible for ensuring that:

* There will be at least 3 Catalysts at any given time.
* Combined Catalyst time must equal at least 1FTE (eg: 2 people 2 days/week plus 1 person 1 day/week) or more.
* Each Catalyst must make a time commitment of at least one day per week.
* Catalysts serve a term of at least 6 months, and not more than 24 months.
* Catalysts meet regularly for support and collaboration.

Catalysts are responsible for defining and managing their own work. The specific functions below are intended to only occupy a small fraction of a Catalysts committed time, with the rest spent on their self-directed work programme.




**Maintain a Network Issues and Initiatives List**

This content must be accessible to everyone and kept up to date. Catalysts are expected to facilitate a range of inputs from the wider network to add issues.

###Processes

**Appointment**

* Three Enspiral Members, acting as Catalyst Stewards, can contact and appoint a new Catalyst of their choice. 
* People who want to become Catalysts can gain support from three Enspiral Members to support their appointment.
* Catalysts Stewards are expected to consult widely in the network before appointing a Catalyst to gather feedback.
* Catalyst Stewards must consider the Diversity Agreement when making appointments.
* New Catalyst appointments are announced in Enspiral News.


**Constraints**

* An Enspiral Member may only Steward one Catalyst at a time.
* Catalysts must be Members or Contributors.
* Catalyst Stewards must ensure that the prospective Catalyst is eligible (can make required commitment and has sufficient funding) and capable (has the skills and leadership capacity).

**Support**

* Catalysts are expected to provide robust peer support to other Catalysts.
* The 3 nominating Catalyst Stewards must provide support and accountability role for the Catalyst for the duration of their term.
* There must be three active Stewards for each Catalyst at all times or the Catalyst is removed unless another Steward can be found. 
* Catalysts are invited to consult with previous Catalysts, the Enspiral Members, the Board of Directors, outside experts, and the wider network as needed.
* If anyone has an issue with a Catalyst that cannot be resolved directly, the Stewards are the contact point.

**Resourcing**

Catalysts Stewards are expected to ensure that Catalysts they wish to appoint have sufficient resourcing in place to successfully fulfil their commitment. 

Funding may come from a range of sources, such as:
* Secondment from an Enspiral Venture.
* Self-funded through independent means.
* External funding (grants, etc)
* Bucket funding.
* Funding from Foundation reserves.

**Completion**

* A Catalyst may resign at any time (but expected to serve at least six months)
* A Catalyst is automatically removed after two years.
* Members can remove a Catalyst with a Loomio decision that goes on for at least 2 weeks, where at least 75% vote yes, regardless of any blocks and with no engagement threshold.
* A Catalyst is automatically removed if they do not have three active Stewards.

###Expectations

Each Catalyst will have their own style of leadership, and diverse approaches are strongly encouraged. However, there are some guiding principles we expect all Catalysts to follow.

* **Gentle** - exercise power with others, not over others.
* **Firm** - hold people to their commitments, especially yourself.
* **Selfless** - subsume your personal motivations to those of the group.
* **Kind** - care for the people, care for yourself. Ask for and offer support.
* **Ambitious** - aim for high standards in both yourself and others.
* **Inclusive** - consistently create opportunities for all kinds of people to engage. 
* **Catalysing** - consciously develop leadership capacity in yourself and others.
* **Holistic** - regard the bigger picture, the longer term, and the network as a whole.
