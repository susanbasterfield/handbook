# New Contributor On-boarding info
When a new contributor joins Enspiral, they receive a series of six email messages over six weeks for orientation to the network - how it functions and how they can participate. In the last email, we ask for feedback about their experience.

The message series is part of a project by the Ops Team at Enspiral to improve the experience of new Contributors coming into Enspiral. If you have feedback or would like to contribute to this project email [foundation@enspiral.com](mailto://foundation@enspiral.com)


## Week 1: Welcome and communications tools
Welcome to Enspiral! We're stoked to have you here.

This is the start of your journey into the Enspiral Network. As a new contributor, you’ll get 3 months to explore what we’re about and see if this community is right for you. Over the next six weeks you’ll be sent a message from us each week to help you along your journey.

Week 1 : Welcome and communications tools

Week 2 : Meet your Enspiral Buddy

Week 3 : What it means to be an Enspiral Contributor

Week 4 : Getting informed about Enspiral

Week 5 : Getting active in Enspiral

Week 6 : Tell us how you’re going

At any time you can access any of these messages on the [Onboarding page in our Enspiral Handbook].

Our communications tools.
At Enspiral we use a number of online platforms to meet our organisational needs. As a new contributor, you should have received an invite to all of these. If any of these hasn’t turned up feel free to send us a message at foundation@enspiral.com.

Core channels for everyone :

## Week 2: Meet your Enspiral Buddy

Kia ora 
Soon it will be time to meet your Enspiral Buddy!

As well as the Member who invited you into Enspiral, we make sure every new Contributor has a welcome Buddy to help them on their social journey into the network. Above all else, Enspiral is a community and it’s our relationships with one-another that makes everything work. As a new Contributor, your job is to find the people within our network that most resonate with what you want to create in the world. Your Buddy is here to help.

You will soon receive another email with an introduction to your buddy. After receiving this, contact them to arrange either a meet-up or video call. This will help you both to get to know each other. Your Buddy will ask you questions to understand your intentions and aspirations coming into Enspiral and introduce you to other people in the network who might share similar dreams. Here’s a suggested process the two of you can follow. Your Buddy will also be your first port of call for all your questions about Enspiral.

Happy connecting!


## Week 3 email: So what does it mean to be an Enspiral Contributor?
Kia ora,

So what does it mean to be an Enspiral Contributor?

Enspiral Contributors are the life of Enspiral. But what are you contributing to and how do you do it? Below is an extended version of our [People Agreement](https://enspiral.gitbooks.io/enspiral-handbook/content/people_agreement.html) which sets out what is required, expected and encouraged from Contributors in being valuable citizens of Enspiral.

Required :

  * Accept the invitation to the Enspiral Loomio group

  * Follow agreed Enspiral policies (such as the [Diversity Agreement](https://enspiral.gitbooks.io/enspiral-handbook/content/diversity_agreement.html))

  * Opt in after 3 months and every 12 months after that, and make a self-set financial contribution (see [Financial Agreement](https://enspiral.gitbooks.io/enspiral-handbook/content/financial_agreement.html))

Expected :

  * Participate in online communications channels and collective decisions on Loomio.

  * Allocate funds in [Cobudget](http://cobudget.co/#/groups/41) when you have them.

  * Contribute to the internal culture of support and generosity.

  * Help build Enspiral in your own way - no one here will tell you what to do.

  * If you notice something that can be improved, work on it or talk to people about it. Starting a [seed on Hylo](https://www.hylo.com/c/enspiral) or [posting a bucket idea in Cobudget](http://cobudget.co/#/buckets/new?group_id=41) is a great place to start.

  * If you access an opportunity through Enspiral, set it up to contribute back to the network in some way e.g. become an Enspiral Services contributor, contract Enspiral Ventures to work on it.
  
  * Learn about our social mission and [uphold our values](https://enspiral.gitbooks.io/enspiral-handbook/content/values.html).

Encouraged :

  * Attend Enspiral retreats and events

  * Host events, share your knowledge and skills through our [Chalkle channel](https://chalkle.com/enspiral)

  * Propose buckets in [Cobudget](http://enspiral.us1.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=62b0ebd5c3dbb30bced6e6cf9&id=7ec3a82a55&e=7add41283b), and work on other’s projects

  * Refer opportunities to Enspiral people and ventures

  * Respond to invitations to participate in network initiatives and contribute to setting the direction of the network
  * Do commercial work through ventures in the network to enhance your livelihood and that of others

## Week 5: Getting active in Enspiral**
Kia ora 
Time to get active!
Hopefully by now you’re getting an understanding of the Enspiral beast and are ready to start being an active citizen in our community! Here’s some actions we encourage new Contributors to take.
 
Add your voice to a Loomio discussion happening in the Enspiral Group. Vote in as many decisions as you can - even if you are Abstaining because you don’t have enough context, it’s still valuable participation.
 
Propose or help shape an idea by commenting on Cobudget. Maybe you’ve got fresh insights as to how we can make coming into the network better for other people or some other brainwave of how to contribute to the network. Putting up a bucket on Cobudget is the best way to gather people and funds behind your idea.
 
Post in Slack, Facebook or Hylo - choose your favourite casual discussion channel and share some inspiration, a question, an idea. Make sure you’ve completed your profile on these platforms so others will know what your passions and focus areas are!
 
Come to an Enspiral Retreat (held every 6 months) or an event posted on our Chalkle channel.
 
Take part in a Project Kitchen - a fast and fun way to collaboratively problem-solve on some of the multitude of projects happening in the network. Check the #project_kitchen channel on Slack for upcoming kitchens or put in a request for one to happen!
Happy engaging!
